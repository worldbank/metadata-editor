Enter the date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM or YYYY).\n- Cycle: Identification of the cycle of data collection. The cycle attribute permits specification of the relevant cycle, wave, or round of data. For example, a household consumption survey could visit households in four phases (one per quarter). Each quarter would be a cycle, and the specific dates of data collection for each quarter would be entered.",
