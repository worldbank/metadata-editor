As full transparency in derivation processes is critical to build trust and ensure replicability or reproducibility, the information captured in this element will often not be sufficient. A reference to a document and/or computer program can in such case be provided in this element, and the document/scripts provided as external resources. For example, a variable “TOT_EXP” containing the annualized total household expenditure obtained from a household budget survey may be the result of a complex process of aggregation, de-seasonalization, and more. In such case, the information provided in the Derivation element could be: “TOT_EXP was obtained by aggregating expenditure data on all goods and services, available in sections 4 to 6 of the household questionnaire. It contains imputed rental values for owner-occupied dwellings. The values have been deflated by a regional price deflator available in variable REG_DEF. All values are in local currency. Outliers have been fixed by imputation. Details on the calculations are available in Appendix 2 of the Report on Data Processing, and in the Stata program [generate_hh_exp_total.do].”",
