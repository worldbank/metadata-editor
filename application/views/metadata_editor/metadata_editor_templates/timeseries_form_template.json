In sources, we are mainly interested in the latter. When a series in a database is a series extracted from another database (e.g., when the World Bank World Development Indicators include a series from the World Health Organization in its database), the source organization should be mentioned in the \"Authoring entity\" element of the schema. The sources element is a repeatable element. In international databases where series cover many countries, a series may have a large number of sources (for example, the World Bank poverty headcount data are extracted from hundreds of different national household surveys).
