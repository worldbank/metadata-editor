In sources, we are mainly interested in the latter. When a series in a database is a series extracted from another database (e.g., when the World Bank World Development Indicators include a series from the World Health Organization in its database), the source organization should be mentioned in the \"Authoring entity\" element of the schema. The sources element is a repeatable element. In international databases where series cover many countries, a series may have a large number of sources (for example, the World Bank poverty headcount data are extracted from hundreds of different national household surveys).

The dimensions are features (or “variables”) that define the different levels of disaggregation within an indicator/series. The element dimensions is used to provide an itemized list of disaggregations that correspond exactly to the published data.
