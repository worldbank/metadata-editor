A source can refer to an organization (e.g., “Source: World Health Organization”), or to a dataset (e.g., for a national poverty headcount indicator, the sources will likely be a list of sample household surveys). In sources, we are mainly interested in the latter. When a series in a database is a series extracted from another database (e.g., when the World Bank World Development Indicators include a series from the World Health Organization in its database), the source organization should be mentioned in the \"Authoring entity\" element of the schema. The sources element is a repeatable element. In international databases where series cover many countries, a series may have a large number of sources (for example, the World Bank poverty headcount data are extracted from hundreds of different national household surveys). The content of this element can thus be quite large. This information is however useful, as it contributes to establish the traceability and credibility of the data.\n\n- ID: This element records the unique identifier of a source. It is a required element. If the source does not have a specific unique identifier, a sequential number can be used.
