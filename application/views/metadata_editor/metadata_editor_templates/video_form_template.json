Keep in mind that people do not stay forever in their position.\n- Role: The specific role of name, in regards to supporting users. This element is used when multiple names are provided, to help users identify the most appropriate person or unit to contact.\n- Affiliation: Affiliation of the person/unit.\n- Email: E-mail address of the person.\n- Telephone: A phone number that can be called to obtain information or provide feedback on the table.
