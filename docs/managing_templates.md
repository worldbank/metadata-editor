# Managing templates 

Templates define the metadata entry forms. They provide a way to control what elements are included, in what order and grouping, with what instructions, and labels, with CVs and default values, and validation rules.

NOTES: 
The application comes with pre-loaded Templates (for all data types). Customizing templates is not a requirement to use the ME. But there is probably some value in adapting the provided templates.
You can export and share the templates you produce. You can also import templates from others. 
When you document a dataset, the template is saved in the Project.
Metadata generated using a template can be edited using another template. The selection /switching of the template impacts what is shown in the metadata entry screens; it does not change the content.
