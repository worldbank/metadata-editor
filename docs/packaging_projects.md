# Packaging projects

A project contains data, metadata, and related resources.
The following is saved in the Metadata Editor database:
- Metadata compliant with a standard or schema
- Data (in the case of microdata; in CSV format)
- Optionally, an image file to be used as thumbnail (thumbnail)
- Metadata related to external resources

What is NOT saved in the database:
- The original microdata
- The electronic files of the related resources (PDFs, Excel, etc)
These files are stored in your folders.

You can however package the whole content of a project as a zip file, for archiving and sharing purposes. The package will then contain:
- The standard-compliant metadata in XML and/or JSON format
- Metadata compliant with a standard or schema
- The CSV data as stored  in the Metadata Editor (in the case of microdata)
- The origibal data files that you imported, e.g., Stata files (in the case of microdata)
- The image file (if any) used as thumbnail
- The external resources available as electronic files

A package can be opened directly by the Metadata Editor.
