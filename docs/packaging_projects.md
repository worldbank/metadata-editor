# Packaging projects

A project contains data, metadata, and related resources.
The following is saved in the Metadata Editor database:
- Metadata compliant with a standard or schema
- Data (in the case of microdata; in CSV format)
- Optionally, an image file to be used as thumbnail (thumbnail)
- Metadata related to external resources

What is NOT saved in the database:
- The original microdata
- The electronic files of the related resources (PDFs, Excel, etc)
These files are stored in your folders.

You can however package the whole content of a project as a zip file, for archiving and sharing purposes. The package will then contain:
- The standard-compliant metadata in XML and/or JSON format
- Metadata compliant with a standard or schema
- The CSV data as stored  in the Metadata Editor (in the case of microdata)
- The origibal data files that you imported, e.g., Stata files (in the case of microdata)
- The image file (if any) used as thumbnail
- The external resources available as electronic files

To generate the package, click on "Export package (zip)" in the "Project" menu item.

A zip file will be generated and saved in your "Download" folder. The file will be named using the project identifier as filename (user-defined ID if available, otherwise the system ID). The file contains all resources related to your project (data, metadata, thumbnail, and external resources). This file can be used for archiving purpose, or shared with other users. The zip package can be imported into the Metadata Editor as a new project.
