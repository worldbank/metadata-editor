The Metadata Editor application was developed by Mehmood Asghar (software developer / data engineer) with Olivier Dupriez (statistician / data scientist). 

Other contributors include:
- Tefera Bekele (test / input on microdata import)
- Cathrine Machingauta (...)
- Aivin Solatorio (...)

The application was in part inspired by the Nesstar Publisher software application (by the Norwegian Social Science Data Archive). The Nesstar Publisher, designed for the production of DDI-compliant metadata for microdata, is not maintained anymore. But the Metadata Editor interface is largely inspired from Nesstar. A large community of data curators have relied on Nesstar, and will be familiar with the interface. We express our gratitude to the Nesstar developers for our past collaboration and for allowing us to replicate much of their user interface.
