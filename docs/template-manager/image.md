## The Image metadata schemas

The Metadata Editor provides two options for the documentation of images: a simple one based on the Dublin Come (DCMI option), and a more complex one based on the IPTC standard. It makes use of the Dublin Core metadata standard to document **external resources**. External resources are files or links that provide content other than the metadata stored in the DDI. This may consist of images files or any other resource available in digital format.

## Preparing your photos

Recommendations

- To make the documents discoverable: caption and keywords, and possibly topics. Use ML tools like Google Vision for labeling images. For topics, use a controlled vocabulary if available.
- What you can get from EXIF

We describe the documentation process with an example. We selected an image from the World Bank Flickr collection. The image is available at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/8120361619/in/album-72157648790716931/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/1129045136/in/album-72157608066422023/)

Add the image file(s) or a link to the image as an external resource. SAVE.
The image is made available in multiple formats. We assume that we want to only provide access to the small, medium and original version of the image available in our NADA catalog.
