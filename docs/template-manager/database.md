# Database

## The Database schema

Time series are often contained in multi-indicators databases, like the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI), whose on-line version contains series for 1,430 indicators (as of 2023). The Metadata Editor propose two different metadata schemas for documenting databases like the WDI: one to document each series/indicators individually, and the other one to document the database they belong to. In this chapter, we describe the metadata schema used to describe the database (i.e. the container of indicators).

In a NADA catalog, the information on a database can be published either as an entry *per se* (to provide a catalog of databases), or as an “attachment” to the information related to an indicator/series. When published as complementary information of an indicator, the metadata related to the database will be displayed in a SOURCE DATABASE tab in a page describing an indicator.

## Creating or editing a database project

You create a new database project by clicking on "Create new project" in the Projects page and, when prompted, select "Database" as data type. Enter metadata with as much relevant information as possible. In the example, below, we use the World Bank's World Development Indicator (WDI) database as an example.

## Publishing in NADA

A database can be published as an entry in a NADA catalog, in which case a tab "Databases" will be displayed, or as a complement of information to indicators/time series (in which case the database metadata will only be displayed in a tab, and not indexed).
