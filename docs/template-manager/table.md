# Table

## The Table metadata schema

A statistical table (cross tabulation or contingency table) is a summary presentation of data. The OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms defines it as “observation data gained by a purposeful aggregation of statistical microdata conforming to statistical methodology [organized in] groups or aggregates, such as counts, means, or frequencies.”

Tables are produced as an array of rows and columns that display numeric aggregates in a clearly labeled fashion. They may have a complex structure and become quite elaborate. They are typically found in publications such as statistical yearbooks, census and survey reports, research papers, or published on-line.

Statistical tables can be understood by a broad audience. In some cases, they may be the only publicly-available output of a data collection activity. Even when other output is available –such as microdata, dashboards, or databases accessible via user interfaces or APIs– statistical tables are an important component of data dissemination. It is thus important to make tables as discoverable as possible. The schema used in the Metadata Editor was designed to structure and foster the comprehensiveness of information on tables by rendering the pertinent metadata into a structured, machine-readable format. It is intended for the purpose of improving data discoverability. The schema is not intended to store information to programmatically re-create tables.

The schema description is available at http://dev.ihsn.org/nada/api-documentation/catalog-admin/index.html#tag/Tables

## Anatomy of a table

The figure below, adapted from LabWrite Resources (https://labwrite.ncsu.edu/res/gh/gh-tables.html), provides an illustration of what statistical tables typically look like. The main parts of a table are highlighted. They provide a content structure for the metadata schema we use in the Metadata Editor.
