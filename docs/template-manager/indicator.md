# Indicators

Indicators vs time series.
Metadata schema developed by compiling elements from multiple databases like WDI and SDGs.
Indicators are typically organized in a database. WDI, ADB KI, etc. We document the indicator/series, but also have a template for database.
In catalog, entries are series. But attach metadata of database for information.
In NADA, can publish metadata and data that become available via API. Metadata Editor for metadata only. Future versions may provide tools for publishing data.

Documenting time series is easy. Only requires selection of a template, then fill out metadata entry form. If you have many indicators from a same database/organization, consider entering default values in the template. 

The Metadata Editor makes use of the ... metadata standard for the documentation of indicators.

## The ... metadata schema

For the documentation of indicators, the Metadata Editor also makes use of the Dublin Core metadata standard to document **external resources**. External resources are files or links that provide content other than the metadata stored in the DDI. This may consist of PDF questionnaires or manuals, scripts, images, or any other resource available in digital format.
