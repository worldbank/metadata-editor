# Indicators

Indicators vs time series.
Metadata schema developed by compiling elements from multiple databases like WDI and SDGs.
Indicators are typically organized in a database. WDI, ADB KI, etc. We document the indicator/series, but also have a template for database.
In catalog, entries are series. But attach metadata of database for information.
In NADA, can publish metadata and data that become available via API. Metadata Editor for metadata only. Future versions may provide tools for publishing data.

Documenting time series is easy. Only requires selection of a template, then fill out metadata entry form. If you have many indicators from a same database/organization, consider entering default values in the template.

This may consist of PDF questionnaires or manuals, scripts, images, or any other resource available in digital format.
