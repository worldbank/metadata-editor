## The ... metadata schema


For the documentation of documents, the Metadata Editor also makes use of the Dublin Core metadata standard to document **external resources**. External resources are files or links that provide content other than the metadata stored in the DDI. This may consist of PDF questionnaires or manuals, scripts, images, or any other resource available in digital format.
