# Document

The Metadata Editor makes use of the ... metadata standard for the documentation of documents.

## The ... metadata schema

For the documentation of documents, the Metadata Editor also makes use of the Dublin Core metadata standard to document **external resources**. External resources are files or links that provide content other than the metadata stored in the DDI. This may consist of PDF questionnaires or manuals, scripts, images, or any other resource available in digital format.

## Preparing your documents

Recommendations

To make the documents discoverable: abstract and keywords, and topics. Use ML tools. For topics, use a controlled vocabulary if available.
Structured metadata will enable advanced search if available in the catalog application.
Will generate metadata; ideally, in cataloguing application, you will index not only the metadata but also the full text. See NLP4DEV.
Pay attention to capitalization of title and sub-title.

The elements that are required to form a complete bibliographic citation depend on the type of document. The table below, adapted from the BibTex templates, provides a list of required and optional fields by type of document:


   | Document type                      | Required fields                   | Optional fields                      |
