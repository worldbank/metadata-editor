# Research projects and scripts

## The Script metadata schema

To document research projects and scripts, the Metadata Editor uses a custom schema. It makes use of the Dublin Core metadata standard to document **external resources**. External resources are files or links that provide content other than the metadata stored in the DDI. This may consist of programs and scripts, PDF documents, or any other resource available in digital format.


## Preparing your scripts

Recommendations

- Use a style guide.
- Be specific on version of software and libraries
- Name your scripts in meaningful manner, with sequence.
- Establish links with data and output.
