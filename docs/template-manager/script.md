# Research projects and scripts

## The Script metadata schema

Documenting, cataloguing and disseminating data has the potential to increase the volume and diversity of data analysis. There is also much value in documenting, cataloguing and disseminating data processing and analysis scripts. Technological solutions such as GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks or Jupiter Lab facilitate the preservation and sharing of code, and enable collaborative work around data analysis. Coding style guides like the Google style guides and the Guide to Reproducible Code in Ecology and Evolution by the British Ecological Society, contribute to foster the usability, adaptability, and reproducibility of code. But these tools and guidelines do not fully address the issue of cataloguing and discoverability of the data processing and analysis programs and scripts. We propose –as a complement to collaboration tools and style guides– a metadata schema to document data analysis projects and scripts. The production of structured metadata will contribute not only to discoverability, but also to the reproducibility, replicability, and auditability of data analytics.

To document research projects and scripts, the Metadata Editor uses a custom schema. It makes use of the Dublin Core metadata standard to document **external resources**. External resources are files or links that provide content other than the metadata stored in the DDI. This may consist of programs and scripts, PDF documents, or any other resource available in digital format.

## Preparing your scripts

Recommendations

- Use a style guide.
- Be specific on version of software and libraries
- Name your scripts in meaningful manner, with sequence.
- Establish links with data and output.

## Creating a new project

From the Project page, click on "Create new project". When prompted, select "Script".

The default template is activated. If you need to change the template, select "Switch template".

We describe the documentation process with an example. We use the World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No 9412 "Predicting Food Crises" as an example of documentation and publishing of reproducible code.

We can import an image to be used as thumbnail (in a NADA catalog).

Enter the metadata. Be as complete as you can.
