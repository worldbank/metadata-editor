# External resources

External resources are not a specific type of data. They are resources of any type (data, document, web page, or any other type of resource that can be provided as an electronic file or a web link) that can be attached as a “related resource” to a catalog entry. A schema that is intentionally kept very simple, based on the Dublin Core standard, is used to describe these resources. This schema will never be used independently; it will always be used in combination with one of the other metadata standards and schemas documented in this Guide.

The table below shows some examples of the kind of external resources that may be attached to the metadata of different data types.


| Data type          | Resources that may be documented and published as external resources  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Document           | MS-Excel version of tables included in a publication ; PDF/DOC version of the publication ; visualizations files (scripts and image) for visualizations included in the publication ; link to electronic annexes |
| Microdata          | survey questionnaire ; survey report ; technical documentation (sampling, etc.) ; data entry application ; survey budget in Excel ; microdata files in different formats ; link to an external website|
| Geographic dataset | link to an interactive web application ; technical documentation in PDF ; data analysis scripts ; publicly accessible data files |
| Time series        | link to a database query interface ; technical documents ; link to external websites ; visualization scripts |
| Tables             | link to an organization website ; tabulation scripts | electronic copy of the table |
| Images             | image files in different formats and resolutions ; link to a photo album application ; link to a photographer website |
| Audio recordings   | audio file in MP3 or other format ; transcript in PDF |
| Videos             | video file in WAV or other format ; transcript in PDF |
| Scripts            | publication ; link to a package/library web page ; link to datasets | 

## The External resources schema

The schema used to document external resources only contains 16 elements. It is based on the Dublin Core standard.
