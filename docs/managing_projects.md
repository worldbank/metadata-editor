# Managing projects

A project corresponds (the documentation of) a dataset of any type.
All projects are listed in the project page.
The projects you see in the project page are the projects you are authorized to see, based on your credentials. 
If the Metadata Editor is installed on a stand-alone PC, you will see and have access to all projects as you are the owner/administrator of the list. If the application is installed on a server, each user with access to the application will have some roles and permissions. Based on the login/profile, you will see a list of projects that may differ from the list of projects seen by another person with access to the same site. Administrator of the application have access and see all.

The permissions/roles can limit what you can do with a project. Add, edit, delete, publish.

The project page allows projects to be organized by collection. You can filter projects by collection. You can also filter projects by type of data. And you can search by keyword.

The project page will show who created the project and when, and who last updated the project and when .
You can see who has access.
You can share your project.
Only one person at a time can edit the content of a project. If the project is open by someone else, it will be shown in the page.
If a project has warnings, it is shown by an icon.
Different projects can possibly have the same ID. But catalogs cannot. So you must be careful. Duplicated IDs are shown.
